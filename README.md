# Robotic-Arm
This is a basic project which i had done in my B.Tech. By Training some set of multiple images, We can perform some functions like open and close your wrist.
Pick and Drop an object, Up and Down motions and ETC.
In this system, At the software part we have MATLAB for emotion recognition and Arduino IDE software for the Arduino micro controller.

At the hardware part we have Arduino Uno R3 micro controller to control the hardware connected as shown in the block diagram.
The methodology is as follows:
•	At first we have to connect the Arduino micro controller to the PC/laptop.
•	Run the MATLAB code we have .
•	The matlab code will ask for the image as input for the emotion recognition.
•	So when the emotion is matched with the image we give then it will send a signal to the Arduino micro controller.
•	The Arduino micro controller will the turn on the motors with the commands we have already given in the Arduino code.
